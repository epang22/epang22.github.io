Took a graduate level course that provides instruction to help prepare students for teaching at an advanced level. Topics include preparing a syllabus, selecting a textbook, scheduling assignments and examinations, lecture preparation, "chalk and talk" vs. electronic presentations, academic honesty and discipline, preparation of examinations, grading practices, working with teaching assistants, working with colleagues, mentoring outside the classroom, pursuing academic positions, teaching through technical talks, and successful grant writing strategies.
Redesigned and implemented a new TA training procedure for the department.
