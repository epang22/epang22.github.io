I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in the [Schuh Group](http://schuh.mit.edu/) at MIT. My research focuses on the development of zirconia shape-memory ceramic materials. I aim to understand the mechanics and crystallography of the martensitic phase transformation and use this knowledge to improve the material lifetime and push these materials towards the bulk scale. I also work on developing new open-source data analysis packages for electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), particularly related to the emerging dictionary indexing technique (see my [Github](https://github.com/epang22/)). I also research Nitinol, iron, and copper based shape-memory alloys. I use computational tools (machine learning, ThermoCalc, my own custom codes) to design new and improved ceramic and metal alloy compositions.

Previously, during my master's work in the [Rolls-Royce UTC](https://www.rrutc.msm.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, I studied the $\beta$-$\omega$ and $\beta$-$\alpha$" phase transformations in $\beta$-titanium alloys. When I was an undergraduate in the [Voorhees Research Group](https://sites.northwestern.edu/voorhees/) at Northwestern University, I modeled the phase transformation kinetics in thin film materials to quantitatively explain the origin of abnormal kinetics in geometrically constrained systems.

I aim to leverage these skills and experiences to solve complex and impactful problem for society! 

About this site
======
This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
