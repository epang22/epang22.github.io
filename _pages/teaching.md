* *Design Team Coach, 3.041/3.321 (undergraduate & graduate), MIT, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Spring 2020.* Computational materials design course, taught by Prof. Greg Olson. Coached a team of graduate students and post-docs through the design of a novel zirconia ceramic using an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) framework incorporating CALPHAD, analytical, and machine learning tools.
* *Teaching Assistant (Recitation), 3.032 (undergraduate), MIT, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Fall 2019.* Undergraduate core course on mechanical behavior of materials, taught by Prof. Cem Tasan. Responsible for leading recitations, preparing new homeworks for the new curriculum, and grading homeworks.
* *Teaching Assistant (Recitation), 3.032 (undergraduate), MIT, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Fall 2018.* Undergraduate core course on mechanical behavior of materials, taught by Prof. Lorna Gibson. Responsible for leading recitations, preparing quizzes, and grading homeworks and quizzes.
* *Teaching Fellows Seminar, 3.69 (graduate), MIT, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Fall 2018.* Took a graduate level course that provided instruction on preparing a syllabus, lecture preparation, exam preparation, grading practices, working with teaching assistants, mentoring outside the classroom, successful grant writing strategies, and other topics. Also redesigned and implemented a new TA training procedure for the department.
* *Teaching Assistant (Lab), Part IA (undergraduate), University of Cambridge, Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, Spring 2016.* TAâ€™ed two series of labs: 1) thermal expansion, where students measured curvature and resulting bending strains in a bimaterial strip, and 2) creep, where students performed tests of solder wire at room temperature.
* *Gateway Science Workshop Facilitator, GEN_ENG 205 (undergraduate), Northwestern University, McCormick School of Engineering, Fall 2014-Spring 2015.* Taught supplemental recitations for the engineering course sequence (MATLAB/linear algebra, statics/dynamics, systems analysis). Responsible for preparing weekly sessions (a combination of lecture review and problem-solving sessions), developing the curriculum with the course instructors, and participating in a STEM teaching program.
