A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked by me from the previous fork (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

Notes:
- Data in the Mentoring, Service, Awards, and Press sections are pulled from _pages/(relevant .md file), not compiled from the individual files in the named folders
- Data in the Talks and Teaching sections are pulled from the individual files in the named folders (compiled by the named script in _pages/)
- Home page text is defined in: _pages/about.md
